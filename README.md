# Stock Analysis Project  

**Introduction:**  
This project is designed to provide detailed stock analysis for any given ticker symbol. It fetches data and displays a comprehensive chart with the stock's candlestick patterns. Additionally, it offers graphic analysis to help users make informed investment decisions.

**Features:**
**-Simple Moving Averages:** The simple moving average (SMA) is a tool that smoothes out short-term fluctuations in a stocks price and highlights a longer-term trend in the data. I have included 20, 50, and 100-day options.
**-Volume Bars:** What Volume Represents: Volume bars represent the amount of stock traded during a certain period, in this case, over a day timeframe. The amount of volume is displayed visually as verticle bars and if hovered over, they also display a value.
